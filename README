# party-run
## A Command Execution Automator

**party-run** is a minimal command runner that aims to automate running a repetitive sequence of commands (usually during development).

It is designed to run a set of default or user-defined commands either sequentially or in parallel.

### How To Run

#### 1a. Run with default commands

```bash
party run
```

By default `party run` will run sequentially the commands:
  1. `cargo fmt`
  2. `cargo clippy -- -Dwarnings`
  3. `cargo test`

#### 1b. Initalise local configuration file

```bash
party init
```

This generates a local `party.toml`:

```toml
[[tasks]]
command = ["cargo", "fmt"]

[[tasks]]
command = ["cargo", "clippy", "--", "-Dwarnings"]

[[tasks]]
command = ["cargo", "test"]
```

#### 2. Update the configuration file

To verify that the configuration file is correct, run `party info` to view the commands that are about to be ran and `party batch` to verify how the commands are batched for asynchrounous running

#### 3. party run

When ready, run `party run` to execute the commands in the configuration file.

For more information, run `party help`.
